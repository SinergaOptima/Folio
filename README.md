# Folio

A lightweight photo and video viewer built in rust.

Folio is a high-performance, macOS-native media viewer designed with an editorial aesthetic. It uses Tauri for its architecture, leveraging a native Rust backend for lightning-fast media decoding and a modern Vanilla JS/CSS frontend for a polished, glassmorphic UI.

## Features

- **Blazing Fast I/O**: Multi-threaded metadata extraction and aggressive caching via SQLite WAL mode.
- **Media Support**: Full native support for JPG, PNG, WEBP, AVIF, TIFF, GIF, and chunked streaming for video files (MP4, MOV, MKV).
- **Editorial Metadata Overlay**: Press `I` to bring up a beautiful frosted glass overlay with EXIF data (Aperture, Shutter, ISO, Focal Length).
- **Customizable Keybindings**: Fully customizable shortcuts and mouse modifiers via the Settings menu.
- **Native macOS Feel**: Cinematic hardware-accelerated mesh gradient backgrounds, dynamic color tinting based on the active image, and custom magnetic cursors.
- **Precise Zoom**: Buttery smooth, customizable `Shift+Scroll` variable zoom that perfectly tracks the cursor with drag panning.

## Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

### "App is damaged and can't be opened" (macOS)
Because Folio is a free, open-source app, it is not cryptographically "notarized" using a paid Apple Developer account ($99/year). Because of this, modern macOS Gatekeeper intentionally marks the downloaded app as "damaged" to force developers into their paid ecosystem, completely hiding the "Open Anyway" button.

**The ONLY way to bypass Apple's block for free apps is a one-time terminal command:**
1. Drag the **Folio** app from the `.dmg` into your **Applications** folder.
2. Open your Mac's **Terminal** app.
3. Copy and paste this exact command and press Enter:
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Folio.app
```
This simply strips Apple's "quarantine" flag from the file. You will now be able to open Folio normally forever!
